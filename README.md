OCP-Telco-Open_3GPP_RAI Evenstar

This interface is inspired by the success of the Switch Abstraction Interface (SAI) in open networking, which has significantly simplified network integration and interoperability testing (IOT). 

RAI will allow operators and developers to:
•	Interact with any radio unit through a consistent interface: This simplifies integration and accelerates feature rollouts.
•	Decouple software and hardware innovation: By separating radio control from the underlying hardware, the RAI enables the development of software-driven radio innovations without requiring changes to the hardware itself.
•	Facilitate the deployment of ruApps: Real-time applications can interact with radio units directly, making optimal decisions based on real-time data.
